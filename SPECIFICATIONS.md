# Specification for the OpenWorkDocs Repository

## Overview

The **OpenWorkDocs** repository is an open-source GitHub project designed to provide reusable, customizable company document templates, including policies, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), how-tos, and more. Initially tailored for US-based tech firms, it is built to scale globally and across various industries. The repository leverages a modular structure, a configuration-driven customization process, and a generation script to produce tailored documents without requiring users to fork the repository. Community contributions via pull requests (PRs) ensure continuous improvement and adaptability. This is a specification document and not all of this may have been implemented or even be in progress.

```

- **modules/**: Contains document-specific subdirectories with modular Markdown files:
  - `base.md`: Generic content applicable to most companies.
  - Industry-specific files (e.g., `tech_company.md`, `healthcare.md`).
  - Region-specific files (e.g., `us_specific.md`, `eu_compliant.md`).
- **templates/**: Includes a sample `company_config.yaml` and the `generate.py` script.
- **docs/**: Houses user guides, contribution instructions, FAQs, and a `module_organization.md` detailing naming conventions.
- **tests/**: Provides automated tests for the generation script and sample configurations.
- **integrations/**: Offers scripts for importing generated documents into platforms like Confluence, MediaWiki or Notion.
- **LICENSE**: Uses the MIT License for maximum flexibility.
- **README.md**: Features a project overview, setup instructions, and a call-to-action for contributions.

#### 1.2 Module Organization and Naming Conventions

- **Document Categories**: Each document type (e.g., `code_of_conduct`, `time_off_policy`) resides in its own subdirectory.
- **Module Types**:
  - `base.md`: Core content suitable for most companies.
  - Industry-specific: Named by industry (e.g., `tech_company.md`, `healthcare.md`).
  - Role-specific: Tailored to employee types (e.g., `clinical_staff.md`, `software_developer.md`).
  - Region-specific: Ensures legal compliance (e.g., `us_specific.md`, `eu_gdpr.md`).
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `remote_workers.md`).
  - Avoid special characters to ensure system compatibility.
- **Extensibility**: New categories or modules can be proposed via PRs, adhering to the established naming conventions.

### 2. Customization Process

Companies can customize documents using a configuration file and a generation script, eliminating the need to fork the repository.

#### 2.1 Configuration File (`company_config.yaml`)

- **Purpose**: Defines the base commit, variables, and selected modules for customization.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  base_commit: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"  # Locks to a specific commit
  variables:
    company_name: "Acme Corp"
    logo_url: "https://acme.com/logo.png"
    industry: "Technology"
    region: "US"
  policies:
    code_of_conduct:
      - base
      - tech_company
    time_off_policy:
      - base
      - us_specific
    dress_code:
      - base
      - software_developer
  ```
- **Usage**: Stored locally or in a company’s own repository and passed to `generate.py`.

#### 2.2 Generation Script (`generate.py`)

- **Purpose**: Combines selected modules, applies variable substitutions, and outputs customized documents.
- **Features**:
  - Clones the repository at the specified commit.
  - Uses Jinja2 to render templates with variables from `company_config.yaml`.
  - Outputs Markdown files to a designated directory (e.g., `output/`).
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  python generate.py --config company_config.yaml --output output/
  ```
- **Example Output**:
  - `output/code_of_conduct.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Acme Corp Code of Conduct

    Welcome to Acme Corp! We value respect and integrity.

    Innovation and collaboration are core to our tech culture.

#### 2.3 Templating

- **Engine**: Jinja2 for dynamic content rendering.
- **Example Module (`code_of_conduct/base.md`)**:
  ```markdown
  # {{ company_name }} Code of Conduct

  Welcome to {{ company_name }}! We value respect and integrity.

  {% if industry == "Technology" %}
  Innovation and collaboration are core to our tech culture.
  {% endif %}
  ```

#### 2.4 Customization Without Forking

- Companies maintain their `company_config.yaml` externally and regenerate documents as needed.
- To update documents, they adjust the `base_commit` and rerun `generate.py`.
