# {{ company_name }} Remote Work-Life Balance Guidelines

## Introduction

{{ company_name }} values the wellbeing of our team members and recognizes that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is especially important in a remote environment. This document provides guidance for establishing boundaries and practices that support sustainable remote work.

## Setting Boundaries

### Working Hours

* Define your regular working hours based on team needs and personal circumstances
* Communicate your standard schedule to colleagues through {{ schedule_sharing|default('calendar sharing and status indicators') }}
* Honor your designated start and end times consistently
* {% if flexible_hours|default(true) %}Take advantage of flexible scheduling when available, while meeting core hours requirements{% endif %}

### Physical Workspace

* Designate a specific area for work that you can "leave" at the end of the day
* Create visual and physical separation between work and personal spaces when possible
* Consider using rituals to transition between work and personal time

### Digital Boundaries

* Set notifications to "Do Not Disturb" outside working hours
* {% if notification_settings|default(true) %}Configure work application notifications to respect your working hours{% endif %}
* Consider using separate devices or user accounts for work and personal activities
* Establish clear expectations with your team about after-hours communications

## Preventing Burnout

### Taking Breaks

* Follow the {{ break_recommendation|default('5-10 minute break every hour') }} guideline
* Step away from your workspace for lunch rather than eating at your desk
* Use break time to move physically and rest your eyes from screens
* Consider using techniques like the Pomodoro Method to structure work periods and breaks

### Managing Overtime

* Be mindful of gradually extending working hours
* Log off at your designated end time consistently
* If overtime is necessary, compensate by taking equivalent time off later
* Discuss with your manager if you consistently need more time to complete your work

### Using Time Off

* Take your earned vacation time and holidays
* Fully disconnect during time off â€“ avoid checking work communications
* Plan for coverage during your absence
* Remember that taking time to recharge improves overall productivity and creativity

## Staying Connected Without Being "Always On"

* Distinguish between urgent and non-urgent communications
* Use asynchronous communication methods for non-urgent matters
* Be clear about response time expectations when making requests
* Respect others' boundaries and working hours

## Physical and Mental Wellbeing

### Physical Health

* Create an ergonomic workspace to prevent physical strain
* Take regular movement breaks throughout the day
* Consider a daily walk or exercise to replace the natural movement of a commute
* Pay attention to adequate lighting and comfortable temperature in your workspace

### Mental Health

* Build transition rituals to start and end your workday

## Communication About Workload

## Manager Responsibilities

Managers of remote teams should:

* Check in regularly about workload and capacity
* Respect team members' working hours and time off
* Recognize signs of burnout and address them proactively
* Ensure equitable treatment between remote and in-office staff

## Team Norms and Expectations

{% if team_norms|default(true) %}
* Each team should establish clear norms around availability, response times, and meeting schedules
* Teams should revisit and adjust these norms periodically based on feedback
* Consider team members in different time zones when establishing expectations
{% endif %}

Remember that maintaining good work-life balance is a shared responsibility between individual employees, managers, and the company as a whole.
